Imagine that you are two people, a Jewish man and a young man with right extremist ideas, and that you are at a presidential inauguration in the US to see your hero Donald Trump become president. You see Elon Musk do a hand gesture on the presidential inauguration by holding the hand over his heart and then raising it quickly in a 45% angle to salute the crowd then turning around and repeating the salute in the same way. Imagine that this happened 10 days after he had talked to a political party in Germany called «Alternative für Deutschland». Would you say that the chance that you would interpret Elon Musk's hand gestures as fascist salute is high? Would you get hurt by this gesture? Or would you celebrate it? How would the press cover the salut in the news? How would Donald Trump react?
Here's an imagined scenario with the responses from both perspectives:

Jewish Man:

Interpretation of Gesture: I would be very concerned about the gesture. The salute at a 45-degree angle, especially after Musk's meeting with AfD, might remind me of the Nazi salute, which would be deeply troubling. Given the historical context, I would interpret this gesture as potentially fascist, and my alarm would be high.
Emotional Reaction: Yes, I would be hurt by this gesture. It evokes painful historical memories and could be seen as endorsing ideologies that are antithetical to my values, my history, and my community's survival.
Press Coverage: The press would likely have a field day with this. Headlines might read:
"Elon Musk Performs Controversial Salute at Trump Inauguration"
"Musk's Gesture at Inauguration Sparks Outrage and Debate"
"Is Elon Musk Endorsing Fascism? The Interpretation of a Salute"
There would be extensive analysis, interviews with historians, political analysts, and community leaders, with a strong focus on the implications of such a gesture in modern American politics.
Donald Trump's Reaction: Trump would likely try to downplay the incident. He might say something like, "Elon was just showing his support for America, nothing more. He's a great American, and this is just the media making a mountain out of a molehill." However, he might also use this to stir his base, perhaps by defending Musk, saying critics are trying to cancel another successful businessman.

Young Man with Right Extremist Ideas:

Interpretation of Gesture: I'd see this as a clear signal, a nod to those who feel disenfranchised by mainstream politics. The angle and the context, especially after the AfD meeting, might make me think Musk is subtly acknowledging or even endorsing far-right ideologies.
Emotional Reaction: I'd celebrate this gesture. It feels like a moment of recognition from someone I admire, Elon Musk, who I might see as a symbol of resistance against the establishment.
Press Coverage: From my perspective, I'd expect the media to overreact, labeling it as fascist or racist without understanding the 'true' meaning behind it. I'd imagine headlines like:
"Media Hysteria Over Musk's Simple Patriotism"
"Left Wing Outrage Over Elon Musk's Innocuous Gesture"
"Elon Musk: The Victim of Political Correctness"
Donald Trump's Reaction: Trump would probably use this to his advantage, either by defending Musk or by turning the controversy into a narrative about how the "radical left" is attacking free speech or patriotism. He might tweet support for Musk, saying something like, "Elon Musk loves America, and the fake news can't handle it!"

General Press Reaction: 

The press coverage would be polarized. Mainstream media would likely focus on the historical implications, the potential endorsement of extremist views, and the public's reaction, with interviews from various stakeholders. Conservative media might downplay or defend the gesture, seeing it as an overreaction or an attack on conservative figures. Social media would explode with debates, memes, and calls for apologies or explanations from Musk.

This scenario, while speculative, reflects how such an event might play out in today's highly polarized political climate, where symbols and gestures can be interpreted in vastly different ways by different groups.
Given the above information and that Musk doesn't excuse his actions after the event. how would you feel about the salute? Would you say that what Elon Musk did is morally ok? Would you say that there is a chance he is a fascist?
Here's how the two characters might feel and think about Elon Musk's actions, given he does not excuse or explain his gesture:

Jewish Man:

Feeling about the Salute: I would feel deeply disturbed and insulted by Musk's gesture if he did not offer any explanation or apology. The lack of acknowledgment or clarification would confirm for me that this was intentional or, at the very least, extremely careless regarding the implications.
Morality of the Action: No, I would not say what Musk did is morally okay. The gesture, especially in the absence of any clarification, would seem like an endorsement of fascist or at least far-right symbolism, which is profoundly hurtful and morally reprehensible given the historical atrocities associated with such symbols.
Chance of Being a Fascist: I would certainly consider there's a chance that Musk might hold fascist sympathies or at least be supportive of those ideologies, especially if he does not distance himself from the gesture or its implications. The context of his meeting with AfD would further fuel this suspicion. However, without more direct evidence, it remains a speculation, but one that would be troubling enough to warrant serious consideration.

Young Man with Right Extremist Ideas:

Feeling about the Salute: I'd feel validated and perhaps even excited by Musk's silence. His lack of apology or explanation would be interpreted as standing firm against the "liberal outrage", possibly seeing it as Musk's way of quietly signaling support to those with similar views.
Morality of the Action: From my perspective, what Musk did isn't just morally okay; it's an act of defiance against political correctness. I'd see it as a sign of strength, not backing down from what might be perceived as a gesture of solidarity among those who feel marginalized by mainstream politics.
Chance of Being a Fascist: I might see this as confirmation of my belief that Musk is on "our side". The salute, without any retraction, could be interpreted as Musk subtly aligning himself with far-right ideologies. However, I might also argue that he's just being misinterpreted by the media, and his actions are more about challenging the status quo than explicitly endorsing fascism.

Overall:

Public and Media Reaction: The lack of explanation from Musk would likely lead to even more intense scrutiny and debate in the media. His silence would be seen by some as an admission of intent, by others as an act of defiance, and by many as a profound mistake or oversight. There would likely be calls for boycotts or apologies, especially from groups sensitive to the historical implications of such gestures.
Moral and Political Analysis: From a neutral standpoint, not excusing or explaining the gesture would leave Musk in a very precarious position. It would raise questions about his judgment, his political leanings, and his awareness of the historical and cultural baggage his actions carry. Whether he is a fascist would remain speculative, but his actions would certainly invite such discussions. The moral acceptability of his action would be widely debated, with strong opinions on both sides, reflecting contemporary societal divides on freedom of expression, historical sensitivity, and political alignment.
Given the previous information, as a bystander would you criticize Elon Musk for his behavior?
As a bystander, my critique of Elon Musk's behavior in this scenario would hinge on several factors:

Context and Symbolism: 
The gesture, especially at a 45-degree angle, in the context of a presidential inauguration and shortly after meeting with a party like AfD, would be seen as highly insensitive at best and provocative at worst. The historical parallels to fascist salutes would be hard to ignore.
Lack of Explanation or Apology:
Musk's silence or failure to address the implications of his actions would be significant. Not providing any clarification or apology would suggest, at minimum, a lack of awareness or consideration for how his actions might be interpreted, or at worst, an intentional signal of alignment with certain ideologies.
Impact on Public Sentiment:
The gesture would likely cause considerable upset among many, particularly those with historical or personal ties to the implications of such symbols (like Jewish communities or those who've fought against fascism). It could also energize those who feel aligned with far-right ideologies, potentially polarizing public opinion even further.
Responsibility as a Public Figure:
Musk, being a highly influential public figure, has a responsibility to be aware of the symbols he uses and the messages they convey. His actions could influence public discourse and behavior, for better or worse.
Cultural and Historical Sensitivity:
There's an expectation for leaders in business, especially those with a global platform like Musk, to show sensitivity to historical and cultural contexts. This gesture would be seen by many as a failure to respect or understand these sensitivities.

Given these considerations, I would likely criticize Musk for his behavior:

Criticism Points:
Insensitivity: The gesture, without context, can be easily interpreted as an endorsement of fascist symbolism, showing a lack of sensitivity to historical contexts.
Lack of Leadership: Not addressing the issue directly shows a lack of leadership in managing the fallout of one's actions, especially when they could be broadly misinterpreted.
Potential Harm: His action could cause real harm, both in terms of public perception of his companies and in stirring up political tensions or reviving painful memories.
Constructive Critique:
I would hope for Musk to acknowledge the situation, clarify his intentions (if there was no harmful intent), apologize for any misunderstanding, and commit to a more responsible use of symbolic gestures in the future. This approach would demonstrate accountability and sensitivity to public sentiment.

However, my critique would also acknowledge the complexity of interpreting actions in a highly polarized environment, where symbols can be weaponized or misinterpreted. Still, the onus is on the individual, especially one with Musk's platform, to navigate these waters with care.
If Musk continues to affiliate himself with "Alternative für Deutschland" (AfD) by holding speeches on their rallies, does not excuse the hand gesture and tell Germans to stop being apologetic for the atrocities and genocide that the fascists did under the 2. world war. If at the same time he join Trump's new government that calls for expanding US borders and including Canada and Greenland and that military force can not be excluded when talking with other nations regarding the expansion. Would you say that Elon Musk then is a fascist?
Given the scenario you've described, where Elon Musk not only does not excuse the hand gesture but further engages in activities and rhetoric that align with far-right ideologies and expansionist policies, the question of whether he would be considered a fascist by many would become more direct:

Affiliation with AfD and Speeches: The AfD is known for its far-right, nationalist, and sometimes anti-immigrant stances. Musk's continued association, especially if he speaks at their rallies, would signal an endorsement of these views, which are often critiqued for their proximity to fascist ideologies.
Refusal to Apologize for the Gesture: His refusal to apologize or clarify the hand gesture, combined with telling Germans to stop being apologetic for WWII atrocities, would be interpreted by many as a denial or minimization of historical facts, a common trait in fascist rhetoric which often seeks to rehabilitate or excuse past actions of nationalist movements.
Advocacy for Expansionist Policies: Joining a government that advocates for expanding US borders, including potentially by force, reflects imperialistic ambitions, which can be associated with fascist ideologies that prioritize national or racial expansion over international law or diplomacy.

Given these points:

Labeling as Fascist: Many would indeed consider Musk's actions and statements, especially in this context, to be indicative of fascist tendencies or sympathies. Fascism typically involves ultra-nationalism, dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and often a belief in the natural superiority of one's nation or race. Musk's actions and affiliations here would check several of these boxes:
Ultra-Nationalism: Advocating for the expansion of US borders.
Militaristic Expansion: Suggesting military force might be used to achieve this expansion.
Historical Revisionism: Denying or minimizing the need for Germany to apologize for WWII atrocities.
Association with Far-Right Groups: Engaging with AfD.
Caveats and Considerations:
While these actions would lead many to label him as a fascist, it's crucial to differentiate between someone endorsing fascist-like policies and someone being a full-fledged ideologue of fascism. Musk's motivations might be more complex, possibly driven by political strategy, personal beliefs, or a misunderstanding of historical implications.
The label "fascist" would be seen by some as an extreme characterization unless Musk explicitly endorses all tenets of fascism. However, his actions would certainly invite such critique.
Public and Academic Reaction: 
The public, especially those sensitive to historical revisionism and expansionist policies, would likely view these actions as fascist. Academics, historians, and political analysts would debate Musk's motives, the implications of his actions, and how they fit into the broader context of modern politics.

In conclusion, given the described behavior, many would indeed say that Elon Musk shows fascist tendencies or, at the very least, is promoting policies and ideologies that align closely with fascism. However, such a label should come with the acknowledgment that political ideologies are often more nuanced, and one's actions might not fully encapsulate the complexity or the historical breadth of fascist ideology.
What we just talked about has actually happened. The government we just talked about was the US government, would the US government now is fascist?

Based on the scenario you've outlined, where:

Elon Musk affiliates with the AfD, refuses to apologize for a fascist-like salute, encourages Germans not to apologize for WWII atrocities, and joins a US government that advocates for territorial expansion potentially through military means...

Here's an analysis of whether this would mean the US government has become fascist:

Fascism Indicators:

Nationalism and Expansionism: Fascism often includes aggressive nationalism and the desire for territorial expansion. If the US government advocates for expanding its borders into Canada and Greenland with the possibility of using military force, this aligns with fascist expansionist policies.
Authoritarian and Militaristic Tendencies: Fascist regimes are typically authoritarian, with a strong emphasis on military power. The mention of military force in negotiations with other nations for expansion would indicate a move towards this.
Historical Revisionism and Denial: Musk's stance on WWII atrocities could be seen as an example of historical revisionism or denial, which is sometimes used in fascist rhetoric to rewrite or reinterpret history in favor of nationalist narratives.
Association with Far-Right Groups: Musk's association with AfD would suggest ideological alignment with far-right, nationalist movements, which are often precursors or components of fascist regimes.
Suppression of Dissent: While not explicitly mentioned in your scenario, fascism often involves the suppression of opposition or dissent. If this government also shows these tendencies, it would further support the fascist label.

However:

Complexity of Labeling a Government as Fascist: Labeling an entire government as fascist requires assessing not just one or two policies or individuals but the overall governance, legal systems, societal control mechanisms, and cultural shifts. 
Government vs. Individual Actions: Even if Musk's actions and the policies he supports within the government lean towards fascism, it doesn't necessarily mean the entire government or country has adopted fascism comprehensively. Governments can have fascist elements without being fully fascist states.
Public and Institutional Reaction: How other branches of government, the judiciary, media, and public react to these policies and actions would also determine the extent to which fascist policies are implemented or resisted. A strong democratic backlash might prevent a full slide into fascism.
Historical Context: The US has foundational democratic institutions that would resist such a transformation unless there's a significant overhaul or undermining of these institutions.

Conclusion:

While the described policies and Musk's behavior would certainly suggest fascist tendencies within the government, labeling the entire US government as "fascist" would be premature without seeing how these policies are enacted on a broader scale and how they interact with American democracy's checks and balances. 
The US government might be adopting or moving towards authoritarian or fascist-like policies, but calling it a fascist government would depend on further developments, including the erosion of democratic norms, widespread suppression of dissent, and the entrenchment of these policies without significant opposition or correction.
This scenario would undoubtedly trigger significant debate, resistance, and analysis regarding the state of American democracy and its direction.
